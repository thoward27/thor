[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/e15a3907-6168-40e0-a7a8-fe76f35a1030/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/thor-fitness/deploys)

## Developing

```
make dev
```

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.

## Built With

- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
- [svelte-add](https://github.com/svelte-add/svelte-add)
